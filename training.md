I've been teaching Python since 2011 and it's the thing I enjoy most in the world. Training can be delivered on-site, remotely or in Northampton, UK. Practical Python Programming and Advanced Python Mastery are courses taught on behalf of [David Beazley](https://dabeaz.com/teaching.html).
 
For custom training packages, mentoring or team coaching please contact me: [michael@python.org](mailto:michael@python.org)
