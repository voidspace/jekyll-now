A three day course covering advanced language features and various aspects of the wider
Python ecosystem. Tooling, best practises and common use cases for the Python programming
language.


This course makes a great follow up from [Practical Python](/practical-python) or courses
like Python for data science that teach you the basics of the langauge. It's had great
feedback from Developers, Testers, Data Scientists, Financial modellers and analysts
who already use Python on a day-to-day basis, but need to know how to get even more
out of the language.

This advanced Python training course will teach you additional  techniques and features
relevant to Python to help you realise its full potential as an elegant language for
rapid development of test scripts and applications. Python is a dynamic object-oriented
programming language. It offers strong support for integration with other development
languages and tools, and comes with extensive standard libraries.

Python also serves as a great introduction to Functional Programming, allowing us to
explore topics such as closures, comprehensions, generators and decorators. And of
course one of the great strengths of Python is the extensive set of libraries.  We take
a tour of some of the more interesting libraries and frameworks available in Python.

1. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AND STRING PROCESSING

    Various advanced examples of using Python for working with text processing, including
    unicdoe, byte-strings, everything the string class has to offer and how to make the
    best of regular expressions.

2. ADVANCED OBJECT ORIENTATION

    The full Python object model. Python from the inside out.

    Inheritance, including multiple inheritance and the method resolution order (mro) and
    why it matters to you.

    Metaprogramming and operator overloading.


3. MODERN APPROACHES TO EXCEPTION HANDLING

    Full Python syntax and features for exception handling, how best to handle exceptions
    including best practises for development and topics like logging.


4. INSTALLING, DEPLOYING and DISTRIBUTING PACKAGES and SYSTEMS

    ``pip`` and ``pip freeze``, what every developer should know.


5. AGILE DEVELOPMENT WITH TDD IN PYTHON

    The advantages of the Test Driven Development approach (test first) and writing effective
    unit tests with both unittest and py.test and using mock objects.

6. Organising Your Code

    When code gets beyond a certain size using standard Python structural tools to
    better organise your code for refactoring, understanding, thinking about and
    distributing your code.

7. ADVANCED LANGUAGE TECHNIQUES

    Decorators, class decorators, Iterators,  Generators and more.

8. FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

    A highly practical approach to functional programming in Python.

    * lambda functions
    * Higher order functions
    * nested functions
    * currying and partial applications
    * closures

9. A Data Science Overview

    A brief overview of working with Numpy, Pandas, OpenPyXl, MatplotLib, and so on.

10. NETWORKING:

    The requests library, the HTTP request response cycle, accesssing APIs, Stream Sockets,
    Datagrams and more.

11. WEB DEVELOPMENT

    A full introduction to modern web development with the Flask web development framework
    including URL routing, view functions, security considerations, web forms and database
    integration with the SQLAlchemy ORM.

12. THREADS AND CONCURRENCY

    Threading and Multiprocessing libraries and the dreaded GIL. Why it matters and when it
    doesn't matter, including how to avoid it with custom C/C++ extensions.

    A dicsussion of distributed computing using techniques like message queues and distributed
    task libraries like celery.

13. WORKING WITH DATABASES

    Connecting directly to databases from Python and using an ORM like SQLAlchemy to avoid the pain.
