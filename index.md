Michael Foord is a Python trainer, coach and contractor. Specialising in teaching Python and the end-to-end automated testing of systems. 

### Software Engineering

I believe that software engineering is as much of an art and a craft as it is a science. I
believe that engineers should care about usability, and that encompasses the whole of
the human computer interface from direct user experience to API design. Iâ€™m passionate
in my belief that testing must be part of engineering if we are to really care about
quality. I believe, and my experience has been, that we can ensure quality in what we
produce through good practises and processes, whilst understanding that there are
always trade-offs involved. Quality means systems that work, that are stable and that
can be easily maintained and extended.
